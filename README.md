# Dijkstra_Project
DSA Project: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
	Build a program that takes a graph, starting location, and end location as input and gives the shortest path as output.

The Program should be able to:
1)	Take any graph as input (To Do)
2)	Heapify Graph (min Heap) (Done)
•	With Heap Operations
3)	Implement Priority Queue (Done)
•	With Priority based on distance
4)	Find the shortest path between two points on a graph using Heaps and queue(Kinda Done)
5)	Save Graphs to file. (To Do)
6)	Load Graphs from file (To Do)
7)	Be Able to Edit Graphs (To Do)


TO DO List:
-	Make it so Code shows Path Taken (Mourad Elshorbagy)
-   Take Graphs an input (Youssef Haytham or Zeyad Sameh)
-   Be able to Edit Graphs (Zeyad Sameh or Youssef Haytham)
-   Save Graphs to File (Amr Edris)
-   Load Graphs from File (Amr Edris)
-   Refactor Code (Everyone)
-   Polish (Everyone)
