# Dijkstra_Project
DSA Project: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
	Build a program that takes a graph, starting location, and end location as input and gives the shortest path as output.

The Program should be able to:
1)	Take any graph as input (To Do)
2)	Heapify Graph (min Heap) (Done)
•	With Heap Operations
3)	Implement Priority Queue (Done)
•	With Priority based on distance
4)	Find the shortest path between two points on a graph using Heaps and queue(Kinda Done)
5)	Save Graphs to file. (To Do)
6)	Load Graphs from file (To Do)
7)	Be Able to Edit Graphs (To Do)


## To Do List:
### Essentials
- Be able to Edit Graphs (Zeyad Sameh or Youssef Haytham)
- Save Graphs to File (Amr Edris)
- Load Graphs from File (Amr Edris)
- Refactor Code (Everyone)
- Polish (Everyone)
- Fix Bugs (Everyone)
- Implement our own Doubly Linked List, as well as Priority Queue (Zeyad & Morad)

### Other Features to Add
- Make it so Interactive Menu has submenus that give user more info. 
- Make it so that when the program lists the name of vertices when asking for source
  in the shortest path function
- Add option to edit node name


## Bugs To Fix:
- Fix infinite loop when inputting string instead of int in all functions 
- Make it so input for vertex names and other similar things uses getline()
  instead of cin, so that it takes a whole sentence and not just one word as input 
- Error handling for all functions
